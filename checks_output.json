        "The script uses a threshold defined as np.mean(envelope) * 1.2 to detect a hit.",
        "The script classifies hits as ghost, normal or accent based on amplitude percentiles: <= 20th percentile ghost, >= 80th percentile accent, otherwise normal.",
        "The script requires manual tuning of the threshold based on input, limiting its generalizability.",
        "The approach does not use AI for classification but aims to add sophistication in future versions.",
        "The author built a script to extract hit times and amplitudes from a drum recording and classify dynamics without AI.",
        "The script is currently not designed for real-time analysis but for file analysis."
